# Software

## Methods

* [MuSiC](https://github.com/xuranw/MuSiC) : MuSiC is an analysis toolkit for single-cell RNA-Seq experiments

* [Bisque](https://github.com/cozygene/bisque) : An R toolkit for accurate and efficient estimation of cell composition ('decomposition') from bulk expression data with single-cell information.

* [CIBERSORT](https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/) : CIBERSORTx is an analytical tool from the Alizadeh Lab and Newman Lab to impute gene expression profiles and provide an estimation of the abundances of member cell types in a mixed cell population, using gene expression data.

* [EPIC](https://epic.gfellerlab.org/) : “Estimating the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells”. Compares the level of expression of genes in a tumor with a library of the gene expression profiles from specific cell types that can be found in tumors and uses this information to predict how many of each type of cell are present ([Racle et al 2017](https://elifesciences.org/articles/26476)).

* [ISOpure](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gm433) : Uses a set of tumor expression profiles and a panel of healthy tissue expression profiles to generate a purified cancer profile for each tumor sample, and an estimate of the proportion of RNA originating from cancerous cells ([Quon et al 2013](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gm433))

* [DSA](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-89#Sec4) : Digital Sorting Algorithm (DSA) for extracting cell-type specific gene expression profiles from mixed tissue samples that is unbiased and does not require prior knowledge of cell type frequencies.

## Simulation

* [SimBu](https://github.com/omnideconv/SimBu) : The goal of SimBu is to simulate pseudo-bulk RNAseq datasets with variable cell-type fractions baed on public or private single-cell RNAseq datasets.

# Resource hubs for deconvolution

* [omnideconv.org](https://omnideconv.org/) : omnideconv is an ecosystem of user-friendly tools and resources for the cell-type deconvolution of any organism and tissue profiled with bulk transcriptomics.
